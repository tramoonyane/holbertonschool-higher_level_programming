Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python
Author: Thetele Ramoonyane
Welcome to this comprehensive guide on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. This README.md file will address key concepts and features of OOP, providing insights into the principles and practices that make Python a powerful and versatile programming language.

What is OOP?
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of "objects." Objects are instances of classes, which are user-defined data types that encapsulate data and the methods that operate on that data. OOP promotes code organization, modularity, and reuse.

"First-Class Everything"
In Python, the language is designed with a "first-class everything" philosophy. This means that everything in Python is an object, including classes, functions, and even modules. This flexibility contributes to the dynamism and expressiveness of Python code.

What is a Class?
A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes and methods that objects of the class will have.

What is an Object and an Instance?
An object is an instance of a class. An instance is a realization of a particular item or element defined by a class.

Difference Between a Class and an Object/Instance
A class is a blueprint, while an object/instance is a concrete entity created from that blueprint. Think of a class as a recipe and an instance as the dish you create using that recipe.

What is an Attribute?
An attribute is a property or characteristic of a class or an instance.

Public, Protected, and Private Attributes
Public Attributes: Accessible from outside the class.
Protected Attributes (Conventional): Accessible within the class and its subclasses.
Private Attributes: Accessible only within the class.
What is self?
self is a convention in Python that represents the instance of the class. It is the first parameter in the method definition and refers to the instance on which the method is called.

What is a Method?
A method is a function that is associated with an object and can access its attributes.

The Special __init__ Method
__init__ is a special method in Python classes, known as the constructor. It is called when an object is created and is used to initialize its attributes.

Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
Data Abstraction: Presenting essential features without the unnecessary details.
Data Encapsulation: Bundling of data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class).
Information Hiding: Restricting access to certain details of an object.
What is a Property?
A property is a special kind of attribute that can be accessed like an attribute but has methods associated with it.

Attribute vs. Property in Python
An attribute is a data item that belongs to a class or an instance. A property is a special kind of attribute with associated getter, setter, and deleter methods.

Pythonic Way to Write Getters and Setters
Use the @property, @attribute.setter, and @attribute.deleter decorators to create getter, setter, and deleter methods.

Dynamically Creating Arbitrary New Attributes
You can dynamically create attributes using the dot notation or the setattr() function.

Binding Attributes to Objects and Classes
Attributes can be bound to objects or classes by assignment.

__dict__ of a Class/Instance
__dict__ is a dictionary containing a class or instance's attributes.

How Python Finds Attributes
Python follows a search order called the Method Resolution Order (MRO) to find attributes.

Using getattr Function
getattr(object, attribute) is a built-in function that gets the value of the specified attribute.
